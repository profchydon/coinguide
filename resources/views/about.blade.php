            Coinguide is a web app with the aim of guiding crypto traders on the most popular Cryptocurrencies.
            This is achieved by fetching records from different cryptocurrency exchanges with the help of their api and rating these records according to their buy orders.

            Coinguide also aims to keep traders informed about the popular coins. Popular coins are coins with the highest number of orders within a specific time range.

            We hope to become the most reliable platform that accurately ranks coins/tokens based on how much traders and buying a selling using a mathematical algorithms.

              Note: One thing to note is that coinguide  isn’t an exchange nor a website that gives investors financial advise on which coin to buy or not, but rather it simply gets the required data from crypto exchanges's api, processes the data using an algorithm and tells users the coins gaining popularity and those loosing popularity.
